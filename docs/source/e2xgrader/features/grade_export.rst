============

.. image:: img/export_grades.png

Grades can be exported via the export grades option.
Here you can choose between exporting grades for:

1. All assignments
2. All notebooks
3. All cells

Grades will be downloaded as a *csv* file.

Currently the grades for all students and assignments 
will be contained in the *csv* file.

In the future there will be an option to select only
specific assignments / notebooks / cells.
